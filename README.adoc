This repository is meant to hold documentation, tooling and other resources
related to the link:https://www.jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/[Jenkins Infrastructure Project] parts hosted in
link:https://aws.amazon.com/[Amazon Web Services (AWS)].

== Requirements

In order to use this repository to provision the Jenkins infrastructure on AWS, you need:

* An AWS account. Please note that The Jenkins infrastructure uses 2 AWS accounts configured in infra.ci.jenkins:
** `ci-terraform` to allow PRs and testing without impacting the production
** `production-terraform` to apply changes to production
* CLI tooling (Please note that infra.ci.jenkins.io uses a Docker image built from https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-terraform with the up-to-date requirements):
** Terraform v0.13.x CLI to provision the infrastructure
** GNU `make` to ease running the tasks involved in this provisionning
** link:https://github.com/tfsec/tfsec[tfsec]
** link:https://golang.org/[Golang] and link:https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint[golangci-lint] to allow testing with link:https://terratest.gruntwork.io/[terratest]

== HowTo

=== Provision

IMPORTANT: Don't blindly execute the terraform code located in this repository on your own account as it may lead your account bill to significantly increase.

Once you fulfill the requirements, you can use the code located here to provision this infrastructure on your AWS account

* Create a file named `backend-config`, as a "properties file format" (e.g. "key=value" per line) to configure the link:https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html[Terraform S3 Backend storing state]
** This setup is automatically done by infra.ci.jenkins (`backend-config` is git-ignored)

* Run `make help` to print the Makefile manual with all available targets (useful when this `README` is not synced with the `Makefile`)

* Run `make lint` to statically lint the project resources. It fails if you didn't.

* Run `make lint-tests` to statically lint the test resources. It fails if you didn't.

* Run `make prepare` to initialize the local Terraform project (e.g. generates `.terraform` and retrieve dependencies, using the S3 backend)

* Run `make validate` to run a static analysis of the project (both Terraform and terratest code)

* Run `make test` to execute the test harness on the project (uses the terratest code in `./tests/`)

* Run `make plan` to prints the changes planned to be applied on the infrastructure (see this step as a "dry run" of `make deploy`)

* Run `make deploy` to apply the changes to the infrastructure (implies terraform apply with no approval)

=== Pipeline's Workflows

The `Jenkinsfile_k8s` pipeline describe the workflows for this GitOps system.

There 4 possible workflows:

* When on a Pull Request, then the tests are run on the staging environment AND a terraform plan is run on the production environment (to give the maintainer an idea of what should happen if the PR is merged)
* When on the principal branch:
** By default (e.g. a code push, mostly from PR merged), a terraform plan is run on the production AND a deployment is done if the plan succeeds.
** If the trigger is the daily cron, then all tests are run on the staging AND a terraform plan is run on the production. Please note that if the plan detects changes, then it fails because a configuration drift happened.
** If the trigger is manual, then no tests are run at all, a terraform plan is run on the production and a human must approve the pipeline for the deployment to production to happen
